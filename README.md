## Description
This is a banking application that allows users to perform basic operations such as:

1. Create a bank
2. Create an account in a bank
3. Deposit funds in personal accounts
4. Withdraw funds stored in personal accounts
5. Transfer funds between accounts in the same bank
6. View transaction history of personal accounts

## Setup

### Prerequisites
Before we proceed, we should install a couple of things. Also, if you are using a Windows machine, it's recommended to use WSL2.

On Ubuntu/Debian/WSL2(Ubuntu):
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl git-all cmake gcc libssl-dev pkg-config libclang-dev libpq-dev build-essential -y
```
On MacOs:
```
brew install curl cmake git libpq
```
If you don't have `brew` installed, run this:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Next, we need rust and cargo:
```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

### Install Sui
If you are using Github codespaces, it's recommended to use pre-built binaries rather than building them from source.

To download pre-built binaries, you should run `download-sui-binaries.sh` in the terminal. 
This scripts takes three parameters (in this particular order) - `version`, `environment` and `os`:
- sui version, for example `1.15.0`. You can lookup a more up-to-date version available here [SUI Github releases](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases).
- `environment` - that's the environment that you are targeting, in our case it's `devnet`. Other available options are: `testnet` and `mainnet`.
- `os` - name of the os. If you are using Github codespaces, put `ubuntu-x86_64`. Other available options are: `macos-arm64`, `macos-x86_64`, `ubuntu-x86_64`, `windows-x86_64` (not for WSL).

To donwload SUI binaries for codespace, run this command:
```
./download-sui-binaries.sh "v1.15.0" "devnet" "ubuntu-x86_64"
```
and restart your terminal window.

If you prefer to build the binaries from source, run this command in your terminal:
```
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch devnet sui
```

### Install dev tools (not required, might take a while when installin in codespaces)
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/move-language/move move-analyzer --branch sui-move --features "address32"

```

### Run a local network
To run a local network with a pre-built binary (recommended way), run this command:
```
RUST_LOG="off,sui_node=info" sui-test-validator
```

Optionally, you can run it from sources.
```
git clone --branch devnet https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git

cd sui

RUST_LOG="off,sui_node=info" cargo run --bin sui-test-validator
```

### Install SUI Wallet (optionally)
```
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sui-wallet/opcgpfmipidbgpenhmajoajpbobppdil?hl=en-GB
```

### Configure connectivity to a local node
Once the local node is running (using `sui-test-validator`), you should the url of a local node - `http://127.0.0.1:9000` (or similar).
Also, another url in the output is the url of a local faucet - `http://127.0.0.1:9123`.

Next, we need to configure a local node. To initiate the configuration process, run this command in the terminal:
```
sui client active-address
```
The prompt should tell you that there is no configuration found:
```
Config file ["/home/codespace/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml"] doesn't exist, do you want to connect to a Sui Full node server [y/N]?
```
Type `y` and in the following prompts provide a full node url `http://127.0.0.1:9000` and a name for the config, for example, `localnet`.

On the last prompt you will be asked which key scheme to use, just pick the first one (`0` for `ed25519`).

After this, you should see the ouput with the wallet address and a mnemonic phrase to recover this wallet. You can save so later you can import this wallet into SUI Wallet.

Additionally, you can create more addresses and to do so, follow the next section - `Create addresses`.


### Create addresses
For this tutorial we need two separate addresses. To create an address run this command in the terminal:
```
sui client new-address ed25519
```
where:
- `ed25519` is the key scheme (other available options are: `ed25519`, `secp256k1`, `secp256r1`)

And the output should be similar to this:
```
╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Created new keypair and saved it to keystore.                                                   │
├────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ address        │ 0x05db1e318f1e4bc19eb3f2fa407b3ebe1e7c3cd8147665aacf2595201f731519             │
│ keyScheme      │ ed25519                                                                        │
│ recoveryPhrase │ lava perfect chef million beef mean drama guide achieve garden umbrella second │
╰────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```
Use `recoveryPhrase` words to import the address to the wallet app.


### Get localnet SUI tokens
```
curl --location --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "FixedAmountRequest": {
        "recipient": "<ADDRESS>"
    }
}'
```
`<ADDRESS>` - replace this by the output of this command that returns the active address:
```
sui client active-address
```

You can switch to another address by running this command:
```
sui client switch --address <ADDRESS>
```
abd run the HTTP request to mint some SUI tokens to this account as well.

Also, you can top up the balance via the wallet app. To do that, you need to import an account to the wallet.

## Build and publish a smart contract

### Build package
To build tha package, you should run this command:
```
sui move build
```

If the package is built successfully, the next step is to publish the package:
### Publish package
```
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000 --json
```
